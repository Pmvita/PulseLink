COMPLETE FIX APPLIED - RESTART REQUIRED
========================================

I've completely simplified the app setup:

1. ✅ Removed NativeWind temporarily (was causing issues)
2. ✅ Simplified Metro config
3. ✅ Simplified Babel config  
4. ✅ Cleared Expo cache
5. ✅ Created clean, simple test screen

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. STOP your current Expo server (Ctrl+C)

2. Restart with CLEAN cache:
   cd apps/mobile
   npx expo start --clear

3. You should see:
   - Dark gray background (#1f2937)
   - White "⚡ PulseLink" title
   - Blue box with "App is working!" text
   - Black header with "PulseLink" title

If you still see green screen:
- There's a deeper Expo Router configuration issue
- We may need to check app.json or create a custom entry point

The files are ready. Just restart Expo now!
